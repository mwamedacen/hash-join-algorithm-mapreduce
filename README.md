
This is a Java implemention of the hash join algorithm which applies a  join operation on several tables given the join keys.
This algorithm has been tested on dataset of airports frequencies and airports general data.

The goal of this project was to compare different implementations of the Hash Join.

------

In src/HashJoin:

You can a find an implementation for the hash join in memory and an other implemntation based on disk (with a basic file system).

--------

In src/HashJoinMapReduce:

You can find a distributed implementation with Hadoop
